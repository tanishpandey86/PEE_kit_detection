# 🦺 PPE Kit Detection System

An AI-powered real-time Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection system using **YOLOv8**, **FastAPI**, and **React**.

The system detects safety compliance (helmet, jacket, gloves, boots, goggles) from **live video streams** and **uploaded images**, and highlights violations in real time.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔴 Real-time PPE detection via webcam
- 🟢 Image upload & detection
- ⚠️ Automatic violation detection (missing PPE)
- 🎯 Person-wise PPE analysis
- 🎥 Live video streaming using FastAPI
- 📊 Real-time alert system
- 🔄 Start/Stop camera control
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight backend

## 🧪 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|--------|--------|------------|
| `/detect_image` | POST | Upload image & detect PPE |
| `/video_feed` | GET | Live video stream |
| `/latest_status` | GET | Get latest detection status |
| `/toggle_camera` | POST | Start/Stop webcam |

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Webcam captures frames  
2. Human detection model identifies persons  
3. Each person is cropped  
4. PPE model runs on each crop  
5. Missing PPE is detected  
6. Alerts are generated and streamed
